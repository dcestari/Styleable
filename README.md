# Styleable

Add custom styles to views directly from your Storyboard.

## Installation

This library is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'Styleable'

```

## Usage

Once you have it installed, you can take advantage of the custom styles from _Storyboard_, you'll need to change the underlying class of your `UIView`, `UIButton` or `UILabel`.

After this, you can simply tweak the properties in the inspector.
